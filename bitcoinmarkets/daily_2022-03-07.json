How in the hell is that sustainable? \n\nBitcoin and crypto are truly leading indicators. They price things in as fairly as possible by their nature. In this regard, lack of \"government clarity\" is a good thing, a somewhat \"untainted\" market indicator. It's currently telling me the gov will not let this market fall apart.\n\nI think we touch 33k again. Hard floor there, not because of TA, but because some fucking whale bought hard as fuck right in that area last dip. If it goes to that level again, I'll throw in the last of my powder. Unfortunately, in the short term, I am one of the shmucks who bought all the way down. On the other hand, after watching the market go from 3k to 69k in a little over a year, I swore to myself to never take my foot off the gas again.

However, we do still have military superiority (through which the dollar reserve currency status has been inforced ever since the dollar was taken off the gold standard), which is why the US has been pushing for conflict with Russia with provocation after provocation, breaking of treaties and so on for the last 15 years.\n\nThat's not to say that Russia and China are angels, but they do not have any interest in a war with the west.\n\nThe thing is, wether it was in Lybia, Syria, or Ukraine in 2014, they could never get the western public on board with another major war. But it seems now, that by showing the out of context reaction of the bear to relentless poking, they finally got the people cheering for \"being tougher on Putin\".\n\nFurthermore, I think it's a bit more than mental gymnastics when just a few weeks ago people had their bank accounts frozen for sending money in support of a peaceful protest in Canada (what you personally think of the protests is completly irrelevant).\n\nAnother example is the bail-ins in Cyprus which was also justified with \"oh but it's mostly a few Russian oligarchs who have their money parked there\".\n\nA precedent is being established that people's ability to transact can be frozen without a warrant from a judge, just like blanket surveillance (To KeEP uS SaFe FRoM The TeRRoRiStS) is now just an accepted reality.\n\nI think it's very likely you will deeply regret having supported it when it comes around.

TSLA is more of a downtrend than ranging but the bounces are violent.  Weird times we are in, money to be made and money to be lost"

At least the deaths that occur as a result of shitlib economic policy happen to poor people anyway. Y’all can stay at brunch, no worries\n\nEdit: with the Saudis having waked away from talks because we’re not arming the right people to kill Houthi rebels right now, this conversation is relevant right in the here and now"
