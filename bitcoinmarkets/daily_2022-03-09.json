        "body": "I'm starting a new exercise where I write down my assessments of probabilistic scenarios, to better inform my trading plan and how I should design my risk. I think it's really clarifying to get things out of your head and down on a page. Obviously I, like everyone, have no idea what's going to happen, but mapping out possible scenarios is really helpful in designing a trading plan, which traders should always have. If people are interested in this type of content, I'll keep posting it here. Also interested to hear people's takes on my perspective.\n\n\\----------------------------------------\n\nContext: BTC broke out 10% to the upside, bolstered by news of positive executive order. Pullbacks on commodities and safe havens line up with a bounce for risk assets overall. QE ends today, first rate hike next week. Although the long-term macro remains uncertain at best with rising inflation, late-cycle signals and the proposed end of central bank support, all of the expected short-term bearish catalysts are now out in the open. Relief for risk assets is overdue and this could set up for daily continuation.\r  \n\r  \n\\- Continuation with shallow/no pullback - 60%. Lots of confluence for continuation in the short term. BTC resisted putting in new lows over the last six weeks, despite widespread bearishness and negative catalysts. Indicates weakening of multi-month bear trend, increasing probability of continuing bullish momentum. If we have set a macro low, these types of rallies tend to continue without much relief for bears. Our reversal last July was followed by ten green daily candles in a row. If we're to continue upwards, there isn't much reason to pull back at these levels, and the market knows that. Continuation after a brief consolidation is the highest probability scenario. Ideal entries for this scenario are around 41.5k\n\n\r  \n\\- Reversal into continued chop or downtrend - 25%. The second most likely scenario is that this is another bounce, and people are only getting bullish because the price has gone up. This scenario is judged as being relatively likely due to high time frame directional bias, which is down. Reasoning is bearish macro backdrop, an incomplete bear cycle following years of bullishness, overall belief in cycles of psychology and liquidity. Most charts could have impressive rallies over the coming weeks only to make macro lower highs. This backdrop reduces the probability that momentum will show up after a move like yesterday. However, this is judged as less likely overall due to relief being overdue, and continued chop being unnecessary for accumulation or distribution after nearly two months of range.\n\n\r  \n\\- Substantial pullback before continuation - 10%. The most obvious horizontal level for this would be the 39k region. It's acted as resistance on lower time frames for a few weeks now, so an S/R flip of that level before continuing to higher targets is a possible scenario.  This is judged as being relatively unlikely, as we've already seen plenty of accumulation if we're to continue up from here, and such a pullback would essentially erase yesterdays move, making the chart unattractive to momentum players.\n\n\r  \n\\- Prolonged consolidation at current level - 5%. Staying at these levels for multiple days is judged as the least likely for a couple of reasons. Prior arguments for momentum versus additional accumulation apply. The major argument for this scenario is that 42k is a very significant level on higher timeframes stretching back more than a year. Establishing a base here could set the ground for more upside, but with the amount of volatility in the overall picture right now, it's more likely that we'll continue in one direction or another within a short time.\n\n\\---------------------------------------------\n\nThe major reason I'm putting more weight on the bullish scenario is that I feel we've had ample time to price in the known bearish catalysts, meanwhile failing to put in lower lows. While my current view is that a full-on bull trend to new all-time highs is less likely, I feel like bulls have \"clear skies\" in the short term, and a rally off these levels could easily take us up to challenge 50k. My bias started turning bullish yesterday as we continually revisited 39k, but unfortunately I didn't get the pullback I wanted to enter on before our violent breakout. r/R is not as good for longs from this current level, but I'm planning to take on about half the risk I'd want to have on in a scenario where we have a multi-week rally off a macro low, with plans to assess my positioning based on reactions to important levels (and events, of course) in the coming hours and days."

I already have a bottle of Bailey‚Äôs ready to pop for my morning coffee when we wake up to $45k. \r\n\nWhy the current move up? Either because the stock market is up or because [Biden and Yellen](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/09/bitcoin-btc-jumps-after-treasury-statement-on-crypto-executive-order.html) are about to open Coinbase accounts! Maybe not that extreme, but the U.S. wants to be considerate and not break crypto when they look to regulate it. That‚Äôs the best we can hope for.

Recent regression analysis shows the S&P and BTC are correlated over 60%. A falling S&P is a leading indicator to BTC. If BTC is up and the S&P is falling strongly, BTC is likely to follow. Likewise, the subsequence crypto market treats BTC as an index, (for example, the derivative of ETH  and BTC are correlated by 90% in regression analysis). Thus, you can short the alt market based on BTC moves.\n\nYou can actual capitalize on this going the other way. For example, word is the Russian stock exchange is likely to open soon (hence ruble recovering 60% overnight). Word is BTC is correlated to the developing markets (though I havent verified this myself). However, notice crypto markets were up overnight, likewise with developed markets and ruble before NYSE opened. This all hints that the S&P is likely to open higher, and it did.\n\nIt can also work the other way. If foreign markets are all heading down overnight, with crypto added to the pullback, its likely the S&P will open lower with a downtrend.\n\ntl;dr S&P downtrends can be used as a leading indicator for crypto price moves after close.\n\nEdit: Correcting numbers.\n\nEdit: I [recorded another educational video talking about it](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/SPX/6TaSHCM0-BTC-Foreign-Markets-SPX-Developing-Markets-Lead-Lag-BTC/)"

[My source for inflation (low effort find)](https://www.in2013dollars.com/us/inflation/1980?amount=1).\n\nCumulative inflation since 1980 until now is 340% i.e. $1 in 1980 has the same purchasing power as $3.40 today.\n\nNow lets look at golds cumulative gains since 1980. Gold closed Q4 2022 at $692. It closed yesterday at $1988. Cumulative gain of 288%. Note: This assumes your hiding gold bullions in your basement. Not taking into consideration the legal storage costs of gold.\n\nSo actually, /u/No_Speaker8945 is correct here. Gold has less purchasing power as it stands. However, I believe gold goes through decades of being undervalued and then corrects with a big price increase. It'll be interesting to compare this again in 5-10 years.\n\nHope that helps"

Where the\nactions of individuals are con¬≠cerned there are motives more exalted\nthan enlight¬≠ened self-interest, but where collective action has to be\ntaken in the fields of politics and economics, enlight¬≠ened\nself-interest is probably the highest of effective motives. If\npoliticians and their constituents always acted to promote their own\nor their country's long-range self-interest, this world would be an\nearthly paradise. As it is, they often act against their own\ninter¬≠ests, merely to gratify their least creditable passions; the\nworld, in consequence, is a place of misery. **Propa¬≠ganda in favor of\naction that is consonant with en¬≠lightened self-interest appeals to\nreason by means of logical arguments based upon the best available\nevi¬≠dence fully and honestly set forth. Propaganda in fa¬≠vor of action\ndictated by the impulses that are below self-interest offers false,\ngarbled or incomplete evi¬≠dence, avoids logical argument and seeks to\ninfluence its victims by the mere repetition of catchwords, by the\nfurious denunciation of foreign or domestic scape¬≠goats, and by\ncunningly associating the lowest pas¬≠sions with the highest ideals**, so\nthat atrocities come to be perpetrated in the name of God and the most\ncyni¬≠cal kind of Realpolitik is treated as a matter of reli¬≠gious\nprinciple and patriotic duty.\n\nhttps://www.huxley.net/bnw-revisited/#propdem"
